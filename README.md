# 🎯 Rust Guessing Game (WebAssembly Edition)

This is a simple and interactive number guessing game built with Rust and compiled to WebAssembly (WASM). The frontend is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users try to guess a number between 1 and 100, and receive feedback after each guess.

## 🧠 How It Works

- The core game logic is implemented in Rust.
- The Rust code is compiled to WebAssembly using wasm-pack.
- A clean and modern frontend interfaces with the compiled WASM code via JavaScript.
